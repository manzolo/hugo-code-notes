# Welcome to Manzolo Code Notes! 

## üé® Why this blog?

I firmly believe in **learning through sharing**. Every developer faces similar challenges, and often the solution you're looking for has already been found by someone else.

This blog was born to:
- **Document** solutions to common problems
- **Share** knowledge gained in the field  
- **Create** a useful resource for the community
- **Learn** through the writing process

## üîç Looking for something specific?
