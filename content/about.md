# About me üëã

![manzolo](/img/manzolo.jpeg)

I‚Äôm a person constantly striving to improve myself and the world around me. I first discovered computing as a child through video games, and what began as play soon turned into curiosity about the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù behind how things worked.

Professionally, I began my journey working with client‚Äìserver languages and gradually evolved toward web programming, where I now focus on developing REST APIs that connect and integrate diverse systems and technologies.

Out of pure passion, I also explore Python and Arduino, running a small self-managed web server using Docker containers. On it, I experiment with projects such as collecting data from sensors installed on my camper to monitor battery levels, GPS location, and internal/external temperature, integrating them with weather web services.

Recently, I‚Äôve been diving deeper into the world of systems administration, eager to expand my technical foundation and better understand the infrastructure behind modern applications.

I‚Äôm looking for a dynamic environment that believes in investing in people and gives me the freedom to pursue what truly excites me.

Welcome to **Code Notes**, my personal corner of the internet where I document my journey through the ever-evolving world of software development.
